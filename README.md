Excel Data Cleaning and Dashboard Visualization Project

Project Overview
This project aims to clean raw data and visualize it using Excel's powerful features such as Pivot Tables and Dashboards. The end goal is to create an interactive dashboard that provides meaningful insights from the data.

Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

Dashboard Project Dataset : This file contains the row data in form of xlsx.
sheet data: This file contains the raw data in form of png.
Dashboard: This file contains the final dashboard.

Steps to Complete the Project
1. Data Cleaning
Objective: Clean the raw data to ensure it is suitable for analysis.
Steps:
Load Data: Import the raw data into Excel.
Remove Duplicates: Use the Remove Duplicates feature to eliminate duplicate entries.
Normalize Data: Ensure data is in a consistent format (e.g., dates, currency).
Data Transformation: Apply necessary transformations like text to columns, trimming spaces, and converting text cases.

2. Data Analysis with Pivot Tables
Objective: Create Pivot Tables to summarize and analyze the data.
Steps:
Insert Pivot Table: Select the cleaned data and insert a Pivot Table.
Configure Pivot Table: Drag and drop fields into Rows, Columns, and Values to create meaningful summaries.
Apply Filters: Add filters to narrow down the analysis based on specific criteria.
Calculate Metrics: Use Pivot Table calculations to derive metrics such as averages, sums, counts, etc.

3. Dashboard Creation
Objective: Build an interactive dashboard to visualize the insights derived from the Pivot Tables.
Steps:
Design Layout: Plan the layout of your dashboard, including charts, tables, and filters.
Create Charts: Insert charts (e.g., bar, line, pie charts) based on Pivot Table data.
Add Interactivity: Use slicers and timelines to add interactivity to your dashboard.
Link Pivot Tables: Ensure all charts and tables are dynamically linked to the Pivot Tables for real-time updates.
